### Zero Trust Architecture (NIST SP 800-207)

This project aligns with Zero Trust principles:

- **Never trust, always verify** - All requests must carry verified identity
- **Least privilege access** - Default deny, explicit grants only
- **Continuous verification** - Session validation on every request
- **Full audit trail** - All security events logged

## Secure Development Practices

- All dependencies are scanned for known vulnerabilities via Dependabot
- Static application security testing (SAST) is performed via CodeQL
- Secrets must never be hardcoded; use environment variables or secret managers
- All user inputs must be validated and sanitized
- Database queries must use parameterized statements
- Error messages must be generic to users; detailed logs kept internally
